Today I published a new version of the “Electronics Assistant”. The version has the number 1.1.0.

The main change that I introduced is a completely new Ohm law calculation module.

The program is available for download from SourceForge: [https://sourceforge.net/projects/electronics-assistance/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/electronics-assistance/)
